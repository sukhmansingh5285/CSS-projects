Inline Elements
Do not start on a new line: Inline elements sit next to each other horizontally.
Width and height: Inline elements only take up as much width as necessary and do not respect width and height properties.
Padding, margin, and border: Only horizontal padding, margin, and border are respected. Vertical padding, margin, and border do not affect the layout.
Flow: Inline elements flow within a line of text and can wrap to the next line if there is not enough space.

<img>: Image
<strong>: Strong (bold text)
<em>: Emphasis (italic text)
<b>: Bold text
<i>: Italic text

Block Elements
Start on a new line: Block elements always start on a new line and take up the full width available by default.
Width and height: Block elements respect width and height properties.
Padding, margin, and border: All padding, margin, and border properties are respected and affect the layout.
Flow: Block elements stack vertically, one after the other.
